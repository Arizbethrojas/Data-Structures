* Designed a `hashtable`, which is an array of pointers to pointers to sets, wherein users store keys and items
* Created `bag` struct to hold the head and `bagnode` to hold the item itself and a pointer to the next item
* Given a unique key, a `counter` struct can have its value incremented or set to a new value
